            <strong>History</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="my-2">
            I'm a lifelong tech lover who was pulled in a different career
            direction for the first decade of my professional life. Physical
            therapy provided me with a fulfilling way to help people and learn
            amazing new things. I met amaing patients and co-workers and can say
            that I am a better person for it. It was missing something though.
            Growth and challenge.
          </p>
          <p class="my-2">
            Outside of treating professional athletes, physical therapy is a
            relatively stable field. There are long delays between research
            results and their application in the field. Trust me, this is a good
            thing. You want a large body of evidence supporting a treatment
            method before implementing it. The upside of this is that it leads
            to stable, safe, and effective treatment protocols. The downside of
            this is that novel learning experiences are limited and problem
            solving is more human oriented than treatment oriented.
          </p>
          <p class="my-2">
            As I've gotten older I've begun to realize that what I desire in a
            career is continuous learning, problem solving, collaboration, and
            creation. I want to be paid to learn and contribute that knowledge
            to something bigger. I spent a year in the CS program in college and
            ultimately left because at that point in my life I could not handle
            not understanding everything immediately. It was the right choice at
            that point in my life, but as I have matured I have come to realize
            that the challenge is what makes it fulfilling. Being forced to
            admit you don't understand is how you grow and improve.
          </p>
          <p class="my-2">
            And so I came full circle bringing my career back to software and
            web development, a career I find more interesting and fulfilling the
            further down the rabbit hole I go.
