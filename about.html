            <strong>Clif Notes</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            I am a recent transplant to the Research Triangle area and find
            myself enjoying it immensely despite the pandemic. Coffee shops,
            breweries, and local eats would be the norm, and I've been pleased
            with the safety precautions and new to-go options implemented by my
            local shops. I'm a soccer player, climber, and I always enjoy
            getting out for a hike with my four-legged creature.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            <strong>History</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            I'm a lifelong tech lover who was pulled in a different career
            direction for the first decade of my professional life. Physical
            therapy provided me with a fulfilling way to help people, make a
            difference, and have some amazing experiences. I was also fortunate
            to meet wonderful patients and co-workers along the way and can say
            that I am a better person for it. Ultimately, it was missing
            something though. Growth and challenge.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            Outside of edge cases like treating professional athletes and
            performing research studies, physical therapy is a relatively stable
            field. There are long delays between research results and their
            application in the field. A number that was cited in school was 17
            years from research results to widespread acceptance and
            application. Trust me, this is actually a good thing. You want a
            large body of evidence supporting a treatment method before
            implementing it. The upside of this is that it leads to stable,
            safe, and effective treatment protocols. The downside of this is
            that truly novel learning experiences are limited and problem
            solving is more human-oriented than treatment-oriented.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            As I've matured, I've begun to realize that what I desire in a
            career is continuous learning, problem solving, collaboration, and
            creation. I want to learn and contribute that knowledge to something
            bigger, and ideally be compensated for my efforts. I spent time in
            the CS program in college and ultimately left because I could not
            handle not how foreign everything was. I felt like I was behind from
            the start being surrounded by people who had been programming since
            they were young. It was the right choice at that point in my life
            for many reasons, but as I have matured I have come to realize that
            the challenge is what makes it fulfilling. Being forced to admit you
            don't understand is how you grow and improve.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            And so I come full circle, bringing my career back to software and
            web development. It is a career I that I find more interesting and
            fulfilling each day as I wander further down the rabbit hole. There
            are lifetimes of knowledge and learning here and that's just what
            already exists. Tomorrow will bring another lifetime, and I'm ready
            to go.
