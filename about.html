            <strong>Clif Notes</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            I am a transplant to the Research Triangle area and find myself
            enjoying it immensely despite the pandemic. Coffee shops, breweries,
            and local eats would be the norm, and I've been pleased with the
            safety precautions and new to-go options implemented by the local
            shops. I'm a soccer player, climber, and I always enjoy getting out
            for a hike with my four-legged creature.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            <strong>History</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            I'm a lifelong tech lover who was pulled in a different direction
            for the first decade of my professional life. Working in physical
            therapy provided me with a fulfilling way to help people, make a
            difference, and have amazing experiences. I was also fortunate to
            meet wonderful patients and co-workers along the way and can say
            that I am a better person for it. Ultimately, it was missing
            something though. Growth and challenge.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            Outside of treating professional athletes, which is a riot, and
            performing research studies, physical therapy is a relatively stable
            field. There are long delays between research results and their
            application in the field. A number that was cited in school was 17
            years from research results to profession-wide acceptance and
            application. This is actually a good thing. You want a large body of
            evidence supporting a treatment method before mass implementation.
            The upside is that it leads to stable, safe, and effective treatment
            protocols. The downside is that truly novel learning experiences are
            limited and problem solving is more human-oriented than
            treatment-oriented.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            The longer I worked, the more I came to realize that what I desired
            in a career was continuous learning, problem solving, collaboration,
            and creation. I wanted to learn and contribute that knowledge to
            something bigger. Prior to physical therapy, I spent time in the
            computer science program and found it challenging, amazing, and
            terrifying, and I was ultimately pulled away to healthcare. It was
            the right choice at that point in my life for many reasons, but as I
            have matured I have come to realize that the challenge and curiosity
            that was sparked in those classes is still there and is where I want
            to devote my energy.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            And so I come full circle, bringing my career back to software and
            web development. It is a career I that I find more interesting and
            fulfilling each day as I wander further down the rabbit hole. There
            are lifetimes of knowledge and learning here that already exist and
            tomorrow will bring another lifetime. All I can say is bring it on.
