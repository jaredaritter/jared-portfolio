# Welcome to my porfolio's github page!

- So after much back and forth I've decided to go full minimalist chic. I'm talking straight HTML with TailwindCSS for styling. I was absolutely getting hung up on creating a perfect site/portfolio and missing the forest for the trees. Something done is better than something thought about.
- The site will evolve into something more maintainable and DRY at a later date, but for now we're implementing full KISS protocol and moving forward.
- Thanks for looking and please feel free to reach out with questions, comments, or for anything else.
